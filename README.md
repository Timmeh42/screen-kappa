## Screen Kappa - web based screen recorder using browser apis

Built with Vue3/Typescript/SCSS/Vite, as a scratch-my-own-itch project to have an easily accessible screen recorder, and in the process explored some thinking about treating simple UIs as state machines. At one point I had this hosted on the internet with plans to round it out and make it solid  enough for public use.

`npm install` to setup, `npm run dev` to run locally.
